# Tangy Tomatillos 
Tangy Tomatillos was built over a two week period from design to launch by a remote team of two and allows users to discover and learn about films. This project was developed in Turing's front-end software engineering program and focused on our ability to utilize the React framework and ecosystem of tools to optimize performance and usability with a multi-page experience.
